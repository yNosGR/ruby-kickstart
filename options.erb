# ====================
#
# Usage
# -----
#
# http://..../kickstart.rb?hostname=foo.spectrum-health.org&novm&template=bar&fs=baz
#
# Options
# -------
#
# hostname:  Hostname for the machine. Must already be present in internal DNS.
#            If this is omitted, networking will default to DHCP.  If there
#            is no . in the name, .spectrum-health.org will be appended.
#
# snapshot:  Yum snapshot number in the install path.
#
# novm:      If this is set (to anything), a handful of additional packages
#            for physical servers will be installed.
#
# template:  Specifies which kickstart template to use; defaults to "default"
#            (kickstart templates are in the ./ks subdirectory)
#
# fs:        Specifies which filesystem templates to use; defaults to "default"
#            (filesystem templates come in pairs -- one for the command
#            section, the other for %pre -- and are found in ./fs)
#
# distroyum: If this is set (to anything), the default distro yum settings
#            should be left intact. If not, all repos in /etc/yum.repos.d
#            will be removed, and all yum plugins disabled.
